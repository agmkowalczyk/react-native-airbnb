Because of its convenient location right by the centre of Geneva andon the river Arve it was a popular place for bridges even in the 1st century BC.  Many of the neo-classical houses and the inner courtyard gardens are well preserved and have been converted to restaurants, fashion boutiques, workshops, ateliers and antique stores. It is full of charm and character with numerous art, music and theatre events. The city has invested heavily in widening the pavements, limiting traffic, planting wild meadows, trees and even vegetables, installing benches and numerous playgrounds making it perhaps the most pleasant and family friendly, yet interesting and happening place in Geneva.  During Calvinist times when alcohol was prohibited in Geneva, many bars and restaurants sprang up in Carouge and today it remains one of the nicest parts of time for going out in the evening.

Because of its convenient location right by the centre of Geneva andon the river Arve it was a popular place for bridges even in the 1st century BC.  Many of the neo-classical houses and the inner courtyard gardens are well preserved and have been converted to restaurants, fashion boutiques, workshops, ateliers and antique stores. It is full of charm and character with numerous art, music and theatre events. The city has invested heavily in widening the pavements, limiting traffic, planting wild meadows, trees and even vegetables, installing benches and numerous playgrounds making it perhaps the most pleasant and family friendly, yet interesting and happening place in Geneva.  During Calvinist times when alcohol was prohibited in Geneva, many bars and restaurants sprang up in Carouge and today it remains one of the nicest parts of time for going out in the evening.  At the same time it only takes 2","notes":"My two young children will want to come and say hello but will be away all day and will be playing in their playroom when they get home.
